Good Day!

You are the top agents, that have been chosen by the gouvernment to rescue the world.
In the suitcase in front of is an atomic bomb with the power to destroy everything in a 1000 kilometer radius.
Defuse the bomb before the time runs out!

The last agent, who tried - failed. And he dicharged the batteries.
So at first charge them again.

One last hint: anytime you need help, press the red button.

Good luck!
