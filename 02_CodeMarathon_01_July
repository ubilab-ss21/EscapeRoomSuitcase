# Code Marathon 1.July
 
Goals (with descending priority):
0. powerbank concept (BOM?)
1. use LCD Display
2. program battery loading task (led bar + microphone) 
3. make 7-segment display work
4. use OLED Display (for battery task --> LED bar works already: only alternative; very low priority)

 
 Reached Goals:
 0. power bank question in session tomorrow for multiple esp32
 1. solder lcd display first
 2. led bar and microphone work --> Andi is programming this task in the next few days
 3. 7-segment display works, but unfortunately very low illuminance --> amplifier needed (back pack module; even saves pins (5 instead of 16)
 4. done only if time in the end (now with led bar)
