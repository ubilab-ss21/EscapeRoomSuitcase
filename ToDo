 # ToDo 

1. find digital microphone sensor to make ADC redundant
2. create Timetable containing weekly goals
3. formulate concept:
  3a) how do the microcontrollers communicate with each other and the environment?
  3b) how is the hardware connected? What if two microcontrollers need to access the same hardware (e.g. display)?
